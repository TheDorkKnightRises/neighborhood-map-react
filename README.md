# Neighborhood Map

A React web app that shows the map of a neighborhood and suggests points of interest. Part of Udacity's Nanodegree Course.

## Instructions

- Install dependencies. In the project directory, run: `npm install`
- Run the app in the development mode: `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To run a production build (which enables features like caching via service worker):
`npm run build`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
